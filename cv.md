## About me
Meticulous BA with 5 years of experience in IT and passion for high quality applications, I have a great understanding of the software development process. QA and BA experience helps me look at day to day tasks from different angles which helps me come up with better and more creative solutions.

Always try taking a holistic and imaginative approach for day-to-day challenges/tasks. With mostly working without supervision, I’ve developed strong problem-solving, analytical skills along with high attention to detail.

Have excellent communication skills and never underestimate the importance of building strong working relationships with the team and the customer. Am a quick learner, highly motivated and eager to learn new things, love a good challenge.

Very invested in my job, which works well with being responsible and organized. :)
